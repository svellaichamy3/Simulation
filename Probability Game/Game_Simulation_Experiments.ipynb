    "####  A player loses (and the game is over) if they are unable to perform the task (i.e., if they have 0 coins and need to place one in the pot). We define a cycle as A and then B completing their turns. The exception is if a player goes out; that is the final cycle (but it still counts as the last cycle). \n",
